			<p>When it comes to holiday travel, it can be challenging to ensure your flight plans will go through smoothly. Not only is December a challenging month for travel because of weather, but the month between Thanksgiving and Christmas has been an especially busy time for air travel recently. <br>
				<br>

			Some travelers may be particularly skeptical about flying home for the holidays this December becasue of an airline meltdown that happened last year. Following a winter storm in December 2022, Southwest Airlines devastated nearly two million passengers who planned to travel for the holidays. Southwest canceled 17,000 flights over one week. While most airlines took some sort of hit from this storm, Southwest was much slower to recover. Upon trying to get back on track after the storm passed, Southwest also experienced a system crash. According to The Denver Post, Southwest entered a state of "operational emergency" on December 21st.

			<h3>Airports across the whole country suffered. </h3>
			<p>Southwest flight cancellations caused uproar across all of the United States, but there was one airport in particular that suffered. Denver International Airport in Denver, Colorado saw 2,000 canceled flights during the month, most of which were by fault of Southwest. Southwest operates most of its flights out of Denver, and this is the city where the winter storm hit hardest. However, several major US cities were right behind – Seattle saw 1,086 cancellations, Las Vegas saw 1,060, and Chicago Midway saw 1,017. </p>

			<h4> Where is the luggage? </h4>
			<p> It wasn't just passengers that suffered due to Southwest's madness last December - lost luggage was another major problem the airline faced. Hundreds of customers' bags were lost by the airline, and some waited over a week after their scheduled departure to get their luggage back. Passengers waited in deep lines for hours at their local airports to speak with customer service agents, which would almost always result in bad news about the bags.

			<h3>Plans to Rejuvenate in 2023</h3>
			<p>Despite the meltdown that occurred in 2022, Southwest has plans to make up for last year’s unfortunate holiday season this December. <br>
			<br>
			“We have made progress on investments to improve our resiliency, prepare for the upcoming winter season, and deliver on the action plan. We are ready for this winter season, and our relentless pursuit of improvement will continue to guide our path forward,” Southwest said <a href="https://www.southwest.com/travel-disruption-action-plan/#:~:text=Our%20Purpose%20has%20always%20been,recover%20and%20serve%20you%20properly">here. </a>

			<br>
			However, it can be difficult to trust an airline after the agony it has caused in the past. Matthew Szwejbka of the Syracuse Hancock International Airport has tips for travelers on how they can make their holiday traveling experience more pleasant and better ensure they have the highest chance possible of reaching their destinations. <br>
			<br>
			“Always download your airline’s mobile app. It’s the best way to monitor your flight’s status in real-time. Many airlines also make it easy to rebook via the mobile app in the event of a canceled flight,” Szwejbka said. <br>
			<br>
			In addition to using airlines’ mobile apps to stay up to date on flight status, Szwejbka also recommends that travelers take precautions to make sure their flight is not missed – which is another big reason for concern during the holiday travel season. <br>
			<br>
			“We see two primary issues during high volume periods such as holiday travel. First, as we’ve already mentioned, people not arriving on time and therefore missing their flight. Secondly, however, we think it’s important that people monitor real time parking availability,” Szwejbka said. <br>
			<br>
			To avoid the potential issue of missing a flight, Szwejbka recommends arriving at the airport at least two hours prior to scheduled departure time. Szwejbka says for early morning flights, travelers should check to see what time the TSA checkpoint opens at their airport. Szwejbka also says travelers should double-check beforehand that they are not trying to carry any prohibited items through the TSA checkpoint, as this has the potential to hold up the line. <br> 
			<br> 

			According to AAA, 7.5 million Americans are expected to fly for the holidays this year. More people will be flying for the holidays this year than in any other year in the past, making it even more important that travelers are making sure they stay up to date on their plans to ensure smooth sailing. <br>
